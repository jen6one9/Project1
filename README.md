# The Rona Go/No-Go 
As California enters the annual peak months for the wildfire season, there is added complexity and pressure to plan ahead given the current state of the Covid-19 outbreak. Families who are forced to evacuate will need an emergency plan. This project seeks to deliver a simple app that leverages the ca.gov api to retrieve Covid-19 data by county and fire information from the fire.ca.gov api. It features a clean, user interactive map, indicating Covid-19 hotspots and allows users to make informed decisions on where to evacuate to. 
 

 

## User Story
As a family with members at risk for Covid-19, we want to know which areas we can safely evacuate to during a wildfire, so we can make informed decisions and create an action plan accordingly.
